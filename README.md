This is a C program that displays a main menu to the user with four options: add books, display book information, search books by status, and exit. The user can enter their choice by typing a number from 1 to 4 and pressing enter. The program will then perform the corresponding action based on the user's choice.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

The first line #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor directive that includes the standard input/output library in the program.
The main() function is the entry point of the program.
The first three lines inside the main() function use the printf() function to display the main menu to the user.
The next two lines declare a variable a1 of type int and use the scanf() function to read the user's choice into the a1 variable.
The printf() function is then used to display a blank line to separate the main menu from the next prompt.
The if statement checks if the user's choice is 1, and if so, it displays a message indicating that the user can add book information.
The printf() function is then used to display a submenu with three categories: Computer Science, Electronics, and Mechanical.
The variable a2 is declared of type int to store the user's category choice.
The code stops here, and the program will wait for the user to enter their category choice. The rest of the code will be executed based on the user's category choice.
